Serial Kscan3d is a software that allows you to use a Microsoft Kinect or Xtion sensor to scan real objects and generate their digital 3D models on your PC. You can then edit, export and print your 3D models using any 3D graphics software. In this article, we will show you how to use Serial Kscan3d to create 3D models from real objects in a few simple steps.

## Step 1: Download and Install Serial Kscan3d
 
To use Serial Kscan3d, you need to download and install the software on your PC. You can get the latest version of Serial Kscan3d from the developer's website[^1^]. The software is compatible with Windows 7/8/10/11 64-bit and costs $299 for a license. You can also try the software for free for 30 days before purchasing it.
 
## Step 2: Connect Your Sensor and Calibrate It
 
After installing Serial Kscan3d, you need to connect your Kinect or Xtion sensor to your PC using a USB cable. You also need to plug in the power adapter for your sensor. Then, launch Serial Kscan3d and go to the Settings menu. Here, you can select your sensor type, resolution, frame rate and other options. You can also calibrate your sensor by following the instructions on the screen. Calibration is important to ensure accurate scanning results.
 
## Step 3: Scan Your Object and Align the Meshes
 
Now you are ready to scan your object. Place your object on a flat surface and position your sensor about 1 meter away from it. Make sure there is enough lighting and no reflections or shadows on your object. Then, click on the Scan button in Serial Kscan3d and move your sensor around your object slowly and steadily. You will see a live preview of the scan on your screen. Try to cover all angles and sides of your object as much as possible.
 
When you are done scanning, click on the Stop button. Serial Kscan3d will automatically process the scan data and create a 3D mesh of your object. You can then align the meshes by clicking on the Align button. This will merge the overlapping meshes into one coherent model. You can also manually adjust the alignment by using the tools in the toolbar.
 
## Step 4: Edit Your Model and Export It
 
Once you have aligned the meshes, you can edit your model using Serial Kscan3d's features. You can delete unwanted points, smooth data, fill holes, crop, rotate, scale and colorize your model. You can also apply filters, effects and textures to enhance your model's appearance.
 
When you are satisfied with your model, you can export it in various formats such as STL, OBJ, PLY or VRML. You can then open your model in any 3D graphics software such as Maya or 3ds Max for further editing or printing.
 
## Conclusion
 
Serial Kscan3d is a powerful and easy-to-use software that lets you create 3D models from real objects using a Kinect or Xtion sensor. You can scan any object you want and edit, export and print your models with ease. Serial Kscan3d is a great tool for hobbyists, artists, designers, engineers and anyone who wants to explore the world of 3D scanning and modeling.
