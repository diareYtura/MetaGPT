To use ideCAD Structural 7 Full, you need to download and install the software from the official website[^2^]. You can also try it for free for 30 days. After installation, you can start a new project or open an existing one. You can choose the project type, units, code and language. Then you can create your structural model using the intuitive user interface and the rich object library. You can also import models from other software or use the architectural model from ideCAD Architectural. You can then perform the analysis and design of your model using the analysis menu and the design menu. You can also check the results and make adjustments using the inspection menu. Finally, you can generate the construction documents using the documentation menu. You can also export your model to other formats or share it with other stakeholders using the BIM menu.
 
ideCAD Structural 7 Full is a comprehensive solution for structural engineering that integrates all aspects of building design in one BIM model. It helps you save time, money and resources while ensuring quality and accuracy. If you want to learn more about ideCAD Structural 7 Full, you can visit the official website[^2^] or the help page[^1^].

## How to Model Structural Systems with ideCAD Structural 7 Full
 
One of the main features of ideCAD Structural 7 Full is the ability to model structural systems with parametric objects and smart connections. You can use different types of objects to represent beams, columns, slabs, walls, foundations, trusses, braces and other elements. You can also use load-bearing and non-load-bearing walls to define the architectural layout of your building. You can modify the properties of each object, such as dimensions, materials, sections, supports and loads. You can also use the smart connection feature to automatically create connections between objects based on predefined or custom rules. You can also edit the connections manually or use the connection library to choose from various types of connections.
 
To model structural systems with ideCAD Structural 7 Full, you need to use the modeling menu and the object toolbar. You can select the object type you want to create and then click on the drawing area to place it. You can also use the snap and grid options to align your objects. You can also use the copy, move, rotate, mirror and array commands to duplicate or modify your objects. You can also use the edit menu and the property toolbar to change the properties of your objects. You can also use the smart connection menu and the connection toolbar to create or edit connections between your objects. You can also use the view menu and the view toolbar to change the display options of your model.
  
## How to Analyze and Design Structural Systems with ideCAD Structural 7 Full
 
Another important feature of ideCAD Structural 7 Full is the ability to analyze and design structural systems with various methods and tools. You can use different types of analysis methods to calculate the internal forces, displacements, stresses and strains of your model. You can also use different types of design methods to optimize, check and reinforce your model according to the selected code and criteria. You can also use different types of performance-based design methods to evaluate the seismic behavior and risk of your model.
 
To analyze and design structural systems with ideCAD Structural 7 Full, you need to use the analysis menu and the design menu. You can select the analysis type you want to perform and then click on the run button to start the calculation. You can also use the load combination manager to define and manage your load combinations. You can also use the analysis settings dialog box to change the analysis options and parameters. You can also use the design type you want to perform and then click on the run button to start the design. You can also use the design settings dialog box to change the design options and parameters. You can also use the performance-based design menu to perform different types of seismic analysis and risk assessment.
