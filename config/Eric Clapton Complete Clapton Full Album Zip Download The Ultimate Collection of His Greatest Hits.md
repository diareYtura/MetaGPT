Eric Clapton was born in 1945 in England. He grew up listening to blues music and learned to play the guitar at an early age. He joined his first band, The Roosters, when he was 17. He soon became known for his fast and expressive guitar playing, earning the nickname "Slowhand".

Cream was one of the first supergroups and one of the most successful bands of the late 1960s. They blended blues, rock, and psychedelic music, creating classics like Sunshine of Your Love, White Room, and Crossroads. They also performed long and improvised live jams, showcasing their virtuosity and chemistry. However, they also had frequent conflicts and drug problems, leading to their breakup in 1968.
 
After Cream, Eric Clapton joined Blind Faith, another supergroup with Steve Winwood, Ginger Baker, and Ric Grech. They released one album in 1969, which included the hit Can't Find My Way Home. They also performed at the historic Woodstock festival, but disbanded shortly after due to internal tensions and lack of direction.
 
Clapton then formed Derek and the Dominos with Bobby Whitlock, Carl Radle, and Jim Gordon. They recorded one album in 1970, Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs, which is widely regarded as one of the best rock albums of all time. The title track, Layla, was inspired by Clapton's unrequited love for Pattie Boyd, the wife of his friend George Harrison. The album also featured a guest appearance by Duane Allman, who played the famous slide guitar solo on Layla.
 
However, Derek and the Dominos also fell apart due to drug abuse and personal issues. Clapton entered a dark period of depression and heroin addiction, which kept him away from the public eye for several years. He finally returned to the music scene in 1974 with his solo album 461 Ocean Boulevard, which included his cover of Bob Marley's I Shot the Sheriff.
