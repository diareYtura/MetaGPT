Kayakalpa yoga is a system of yoga that aims to enhance the life energy, immunity, youthfulness and longevity of the practitioner. It is based on the ancient Siddha secrets of body immortality and transmutation of sexual energy into spiritual energy. Kayakalpa yoga consists of two main practices: Aswini Mudra and Ojas breathing. Aswini Mudra is a technique of contracting and relaxing the muscles of the anus and lower abdomen, which helps to tone up the nerves and strengthen the central nervous system. Ojas breathing is a technique of inhaling through the nose and exhaling forcefully through the mouth, which helps to activate the pineal gland and the crown chakra, and recirculate the sexual energy into the brain.
  
Kayakalpa yoga has many benefits for physical, mental and spiritual health. It can help to slow down and withstand the ageing process, improve immunity and prevent diseases, postpone death to suit one's wishes, calm the mind and reduce stress, increase concentration and memory power, awaken the inner potential and intuition, and attain self-realization.
