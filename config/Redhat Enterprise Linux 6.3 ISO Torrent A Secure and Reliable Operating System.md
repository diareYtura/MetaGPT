Once you have your subscription, you can log in to the [Red Hat Customer Portal](https://access.redhat.com/downloads) and go to the Downloads section. There you can find the ISO images for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.3 Server, Workstation, Desktop, or HPC Node. You can also choose between different architectures such as x86\_64, i386, or ppc64.
 
Next to each ISO image, you will see a link to download it using torrent. Torrent is a peer-to-peer file sharing protocol that allows you to download large files faster and more efficiently by splitting them into smaller pieces and sharing them with other users. To use torrent, you need a torrent client software such as [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/), [Transmission](https://www.transmissionbt.com/), or [Deluge](https://www.deluge-torrent.org/).
 
After you download the torrent file, you can open it with your torrent client and start downloading the ISO image. Depending on your network speed and availability of peers, this may take some time. Once the download is complete, you can verify the integrity of the ISO image by checking its SHA-256 checksum against the one provided on the Customer Portal.
 
Now you have successfully downloaded Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.3 ISO torrent. You can use it to install or upgrade your system, or create a bootable USB drive or DVD.
