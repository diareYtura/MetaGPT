# Dukun 2007: A Controversial Horror Film Based on a True Story
 
Dukun 2007 is a Malaysian horror film that was filmed in 2006 but released in 2018 after more than a decade of delay. The film is loosely based on the true story of the gruesome murder of a Malaysian politician, Datuk Mazlan Idris, by Mona Fandey, a once mildly popular Malaysian singer-turned-witch doctor convicted in 1993. The film stars Umie Aida as Diana Dahlan, a shaman who is arrested for allegedly killing Datuk Jeffrey, a high-profile businessman during a pagan ritual. Faizal Hussein plays Karim, a public defender who agrees to represent Diana in exchange for her help in finding his missing daughter. The film also features Elyana, Bront Palarae, Adlin Aman Ramlie, Ramli Hassan, Nam Ron, Hasnul Rahmat, Soffi Jikan and Chew Kin Wah in supporting roles.
 
The film was directed by Dain Said and written by Al Jafree Md Yusop and Huzir Sulaiman. It was produced by Astro Shaw and distributed by Columbia Pictures. The film was originally slated to be released in 2007 but it was postponed and no official statements were given, due to the adaptation of a true high-profile murder case and the controversial nature of the film. Mona Fandey's family themselves had voiced their dissatisfaction over the content and basis of the film after announcement of the film release. The producers have since claimed that the film was loosely based on those true events themselves. The film regained significant attention 12 years later when news got around of its leaked footage of the movie resurfaced online drawing stern attention from FINAS, the police and Astro Shaw. After much contemplating on part of Astro Shaw, it was decided and announced that the film will be released nationwide on 5 April 2018.

Dukun 2007 has received mixed reviews from critics and audiences. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 6.6 out of 10 based on four reviews. [^1^] Some critics praised the film for its boldness, suspense, cinematography and performances, especially Umie Aida as Diana Dahlan, who delivers a captivating and chilling portrayal of the charismatic and manipulative shaman. Casey Chong from Casey's Movie Mania wrote: "The numerous courtroom scenes are deftly handled, thanks to excellent performances from Faizal Hussein and Chew Kin Wah, who made quite an impression playing a no-nonsense prosecutor." [^1^]
 
However, some critics criticized the film for its lack of coherence, accuracy and sensitivity. They felt that the film did not explore the true story of Mona Fandey and Datuk Mazlan Idris in depth, and instead focused on the fictional subplot of Karim and his missing daughter. They also felt that the film was too graphic and sensationalized in its depiction of witchcraft and violence. John Lui from The Straits Times (Singapore) wrote: "Exploring one's inner Neil Gaiman is fine, but an exploitation flick about a serial-killing shaman is not quite the place to do it." [^1^]
