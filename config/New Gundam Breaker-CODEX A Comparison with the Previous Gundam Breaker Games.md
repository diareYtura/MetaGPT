The game has a story mode where you can follow the adventures of a group of students from Gunbre High School, who are trying to win the Gunpla Battle Nexus Online (GBN) tournament. You can choose from three different factions: the Justice Force, the Build Divers, or the Breakers. Each faction has its own storyline and characters, as well as different missions and rewards.
 
The game also has a customization mode where you can create your own Gunpla from over 1000 parts and accessories. You can mix and match parts from different Gundam series, such as Universal Century, Cosmic Era, Anno Domini, and more. You can also paint your Gunpla with various colors and decals, and equip them with weapons and skills.
 
The game's combat system is fast-paced and action-packed. You can use melee attacks, ranged attacks, special moves, and EX skills to defeat your enemies. You can also collect parts from fallen enemies and use them to upgrade your Gunpla on the fly. The game supports online multiplayer for up to six players, where you can team up or compete with other players in various modes, such as Team Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Territory Control, and more.

New Gundam Breaker-CODEX is not without its flaws, however. The game has some technical issues, such as bugs, glitches, and crashes. The game also has some balance issues, such as some parts and skills being overpowered or underpowered. The game's difficulty level can also be inconsistent, depending on the mode and the opponents. The game's story mode can also be repetitive and boring, as it mostly consists of doing the same missions over and over again.
