## Get Some Tips
 
Yeah Jam Fury: U, Me, Everybody! is a game that will challenge your skills and make you think outside the box. Some levels may seem impossible at first, but there is always a way to get that mango. Here are some tips that may help you along the way:

- Experiment with different characters and strategies. Sometimes you may need to switch characters multiple times in a single level.
- Use blocks wisely. You can create blocks to make platforms, bridges, walls, or even weapons. You can also destroy blocks to clear paths or create gaps.
- Pay attention to the environment. Some levels may have special elements such as switches, springs, spikes, enemies, or moving platforms that can help or hinder you.
- Learn from your mistakes. If you fall into the abyss or get hit by an enemy, you will respawn at the last checkpoint. Use this opportunity to try a different approach or improve your timing.
- Have fun! Don't get frustrated if you get stuck on a level. Take a break and come back later with a fresh mind.
