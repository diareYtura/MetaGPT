# Isak Samokovlija Nosac Samuel Pdf 28: A Review of a Classic Bosnian Story
 
Isak Samokovlija was a Bosnian Jewish writer who is best known for his stories about the life and culture of the Sephardic Jews in Bosnia. One of his most famous works is *NosaÄ Samuel* (Samuel the Porter), which was published in 1946. The story follows the fate of SaruÄa, a young unmarried woman who lives with her father, stepmother and six half-sisters. She dreams of getting married, but her family does not want to let her go. Her only hope is Samuel, a poor and hardworking porter who has two children from his deceased wife. Samuel's uncle Simon negotiates with SaruÄa's father PapuÄo about the dowry, but the deal is almost ruined by SaruÄa's brother Jakov, who is jealous and resentful of Samuel. However, Samuel decides to marry SaruÄa without any money, out of love and pride. The story explores the themes of love, dignity, poverty and tradition in the Jewish community of Sarajevo.

## Bosnian Literature: A Brief Overview
 
Bosnian literature is a rich and diverse field that encompasses various languages, religions, ethnicities and historical periods. Bosnia and Herzegovina has been influenced by many cultures and civilizations, such as the Illyrians, Romans, Byzantines, Slavs, Ottomans, Austro-Hungarians, Yugoslavs and Europeans. As a result, Bosnian literature reflects a variety of styles, genres and themes, from oral traditions and epic poetry to modern novels and essays.
 
One of the earliest forms of Bosnian literature is the steÄak, a medieval tombstone with carved symbols and inscriptions. The steÄak is a unique cultural heritage of Bosnia and Herzegovina that can be found in various regions of the country. Some of the inscriptions are written in Bosnian Cyrillic, an old alphabet that was used by Bosnian Christians and Muslims alike. The steÄak represents the religious diversity and tolerance of medieval Bosnia.
 
Another important form of Bosnian literature is the sevdalinka, a traditional folk song that expresses love, longing and sorrow. The sevdalinka is often accompanied by a saz, a stringed instrument of Turkish origin. The sevdalinka is considered to be the musical expression of the Bosnian soul, as it reflects the emotions and experiences of the people under various historical circumstances. Some of the most famous sevdalinka singers are Zaim ImamoviÄ, Himzo Polovina and Safet IsoviÄ.
